```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(CTRing)
```

The first step is to import an image of a disk obtained from a CT scanner. These are often in dicom (or dcm) formats.

```{r}
library(oro.dicom)
dcm <-  readDICOM("../extdata/")
```

The next step is to obtain the information in the image header in order to determine pixel size and gray scale used by the CT scanner

```{r}
hdr_df <- dcm$hdr[[1]]
image_info <- getImageInfo(hdr = hdr_df)
```

The next step is convert the gray scale of the image to 8bit gray scale.

```{r}
im <- imageToMatrix(dcm$img)
```
